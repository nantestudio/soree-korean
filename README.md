# Soree Korean 소리 한글

> **iguh ilgumyun hangukuh deurilkuya**

> *If you read this out loud, you'll hear Korean.*

Write Korean the way it **sounds**, not the way it's spelled.

## Why?

Korean developers live in two worlds: Korean thoughts, English keyboards. Every time you switch to 한글 to write a quick comment or message, you break your flow.

Standard romanization systems like Revised Romanization were designed for linguistic accuracy, not for developers who just want to say "이거 왜 안돼?" without switching keyboards.

**Soree** (소리 = sound) is different. It's phonetic. Write what you hear. Anyone reading it aloud—even non-Korean speakers—should sound close enough to be understood.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. No Keyboard Switching
Stay in English mode. Your fingers never leave home row for ㅎㅏㄴㄱㅡㄹ.

### 2. Sound Over Spelling
Write what you **hear**, not what Hangul spells.
- 그것 → `kugut` (not "geugeot")
- 뭐 → `muh` (not "mwo")

### 3. Readable Aloud
If someone reads your text out loud, it should sound like Korean. Even if they don't speak Korean.

### 4. Context Over Precision
Use simpler letters. Let context do the work. `k` handles ㄱ, ㅋ, and ㄲ—readers will figure it out.

### 5. No Hard Rules
These are guidelines, not laws. This system will naturally evolve and **jungchakhe** (정착해/settle) into standard usage as more people adopt it. Language is organic. Write what feels right.

## The Rules (Suggestions, Really)

### Consonants

| Hangul | Soree | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| ㄱ ㅋ ㄲ | **k** | We own K. K-pop, K-drama, K-food. It's ours. |
| ㄷ ㅌ ㄸ | **t** / **d** | `t` when sharp, `d` when soft |
| ㅂ ㅍ ㅃ | **p** / **b** | `p` when sharp, `b` when soft |
| ㅈ ㅊ ㅉ | **j** / **ch** | `j` soft, `ch` aspirated |
| ㅅ ㅆ | **s** | Simple |
| ㄴ | **n** | |
| ㅁ | **m** | |
| ㄹ | **r** / **l** | `r` between vowels, `l` at the end |
| ㅎ | **h** | |
| ㅇ | *(silent)* | Initial ㅇ = no sound |

### Vowels

| Hangul | Soree | Sounds like |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| ㅏ | **a** | "ah" |
| ㅓ | **uh** | "uh" — not the awkward "eo" |
| ㅗ | **o** | "oh" |
| ㅜ | **oo** | "oo" as in "food" |
| ㅡ | **eu** | That Korean sound. You know the one. |
| ㅣ | **i** | "ee" |
| ㅔ ㅐ | **e** | Same sound in modern Korean anyway |
| ㅑ | **ya** | |
| ㅕ | **yuh** | |
| ㅛ | **yo** | |
| ㅠ | **yoo** | |
| ㅘ | **wa** | |
| ㅝ | **wuh** | |
| ㅟ | **wi** | |
| ㅢ | **eui** | |

### 받침 (Final Consonants)

Write what you **hear** in connected speech:
- 있어요 → `issuhyo` (ㅆ carries to next syllable)
- 먹어 → `muhguh` (ㄱ softens between vowels)
- 않아 → `ana` (ㅎ disappears)

## Examples

## Join the Movement

This isn't a rigid standard. It's a starting point.

Use it. Adapt it. Share it. As more Korean developers adopt phonetic romanization, we'll naturally converge on what works best.

**uri kkiri sseugo, uri kkiri jungchakhe.**
(우리끼리 쓰고, 우리끼리 정착해.)
*We write it together, we settle it together.*
